cub3d thoughts
- to know which texture to use use the angle of the ray and the side
	so for example if the angle is in the first half (less than or equal 90) and if the side was X it will be south texture and so on with other angles and sides.
- to raycast you need to cast rays to each line in the grid, but we have squares.
	so iterate through the list of squares and get each line of each square and then store all these lines to use them in the raycasting.
- no need to handle the problems of the 2d rendering for now.
- Assuming that the side length a sqaure or cube is 1 we could use the map to do
	the raycasting.

- To setup all bound of the map we need create them:
	- for simplicity the bound count will be = box count x 4
	-- horizantol bounds
	- we iterate through all rows of the map and for each one we start a bound.
	- the end point of a bound when there's no wall infront of it or if the row is over.
	- another bound is started if the previous one was stopped, and the new one start pos will be the next wall start.
	-- vertical bounds
	- the iteration is flipped.
	- we iterate through all columns... 		{ i < width then j < height}  
	- the end point of a bound when there's no wall infront or if the column is over
	- another bound is started if the previous one was stopped, and the new one start pos will be the next wall start.
